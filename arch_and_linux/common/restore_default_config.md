Just rename the default config files and then re-install the package.

Then the reinstallation will re-create the default conf files. Example:

```
warning: could not get file information for etc/default/grub
```

Or download the package from Arch repos and then extrac the corresponding configuration files.

Or install a new Arch system :)
